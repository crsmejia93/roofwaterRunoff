# Roof Water RunOff 

## Write the pseudocode for the below problem. If you use the numbers provided in the example then the correct pseudocode will calculate the same result.

Objective
* Define the problem by constructing an algorithm using pseudocode
* What control structures (sequence, selection and repetition) are required?
* What variables are required?
* Show a check of your solution with test data for at least two valid test cases

1) Find the average score: 
A program is needed to prompt the user operator for ten exam scores, calculate the average score and display the result to the screen. The average score is calculated as the sum of the scores divided by the number of scores.

2) How much water runs off the roof: 
How much water runs off a roof in a rain storm?

To calculate the runoff from any given rainfall: 
Take the dimensions of the footprint of the roof and convert them to inches. (So, a 50' x 20' roof is 600" x 240"). Multiply the roof dimensions by the number of inches of rainfall. In this example, 600" x 240" x 1" = 144,000 cubic inches of water. Divide that result by 231 to get the number of gallons (because 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches). (144,000/231 = 623.38).
